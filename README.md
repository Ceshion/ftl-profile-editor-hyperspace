ftl-profile-editor
==================

A 3rd-party tool to edit user files for [FTL](http://www.ftlgame.com/). It depends on resources from the game directory, but the game itself will not be modified.

With this, you can unlock any or all ships and achievements in your user profile, or tweak most aspects of saved games: crew, systems, weapons, fires, breaches, etc.

Usage
-----
* Exit FTL. The game must NOT be running.

* Make any desired changes.
* Save, and close the editor.
* Fire up FTL and try out your new ship.
